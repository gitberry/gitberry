SQL / Geofun / HTML / C# and more...

Self described as "curious misfit with a few technical skills"

This github holds repos that demonstrate or "study" various skills/technologies I work with:

## Data ##

1. SQL snippets that include:
   1. random data for testing
   1. PIVOT
  <br />https://github.com/gitberry/SQLSnippets 

1. Hash a database structure to know immediately if any structures has changed
   <br />https://github.com/gitberry/sqlHash

## Geofun / GIS ##

1. c# to convert get google KML into something else - VERY crude - for onetime tasks
<br />https://github.com/gitberry/KMLPoints

3. C# to convert Lat/Lon DMS Coordinates to D decimal - handy when geo data doesn't come the way you need it!
<br />https://github.com/gitberry/LatLonDMS2Dec

## HTML / API's / Vuejs ##

1. Mobile first HTML
<br />https://github.com/gitberry/MobileFirstHTMLexample

4. A simple experiment encrypting/decrypting using vuejs
<br />This concept of decrypting at the js client side is powerful - would like to know more about how apps like Bitwarden do it.  In the meantime I must learn some basics - and I decided to try it in vuejs - which is one of my favourite frontend frameworks (so far..)
<br />https://github.com/gitberry/vuejsSimplyEncryptDecrypt

6. A study of vuejs routes in a SPA (plus IIS and subdirectories off of domains)
<br />https://github.com/gitberry/VuejsRoutingIISSubDirExample

7. A study of vuejs using a simple API
<br />https://github.com/gitberry/StudyVuejsUsingsimpleAPI

1. a crude .net 4.7 API stub (no authentication, no SQL)
<br />https://github.com/gitberry/APIcrudStubExample

# Future Studies / Examples #

Below is some of the items on my interest list. In no particular order:

1. JSON Web Token (JWT) API <img src='thumbUp.jpeg' onClick="alert('I like this!');">
   1. Serve/Generate
   1. Client/Consume
1. A full Authentication API (extra - is 2step extendable.. )
3. In Legacy .NET 4.7: Full CRUD JSON API using EF and MS SQL ( MySQL & sqlite too perhaps) 
4. In .NET 6 or 7 :  Full CRUD JSON  API using EF and MS SQL ( MySQL & sqlite too perhaps)
5. Hyperspectral analysis
   1. Python
   1. ENVI
   1. ArcGIS
   1. ML
1. Python
   1. simple ML (ie character recog)
   1. transactional analysis - reproducing work done here:<br/> https://github.com/laurentran/sequence-labeling
1. Generic Collection app
   1. collecting words/phrases & meta
   1. voting
   1. scheduling (ie word of the day)
1. QR codes:
   1. Generate
   2. extra: decode using camera
   3. authentication loopback
1. Generic Event organizer
   1. Multi user/type authentication (& public viewing)
   1. Schedule/Location coordination
   1. results output
