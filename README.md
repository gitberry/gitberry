SQL / Geofun / HTML / C# and more...

Self described as "curious misfit with a few technical skills"

This github holds repos that demonstrate or "study" various skills/technologies I work with:

## Data ##

1. SQL snippets that include:
   1. random data for testing
   1. PIVOT
  <br />https://github.com/gitberry/SQLSnippets 

1. Hash a database structure to know immediately if any structures has changed
   <br />https://github.com/gitberry/sqlHash

## Geofun/GIS ##

1. c# to convert get google KML into something else - VERY crude - for onetime tasks
https://github.com/gitberry/KMLPoints

3. C# to convert Lat/Lon DMS Coordinates to D decimal - handy when geo data doesn't come the way you need it!

https://github.com/gitberry/LatLonDMS2Dec

## HTML / API's / Vuejs ##

1. Mobile first HTML

7. A study of vuejs using a simple API
